    <title>Salzburg City Explorer - Interactive Map</title>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony (Blues for primary elements, Greens for routes, Ambers for areas, warm neutrals for background) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is structured into a two-column layout on larger screens (Control Panel on left, Map on right) and a stacked layout on smaller screens. This architecture was chosen to provide a clear separation between interactive controls and the primary map visualization. The Control Panel acts as a dashboard, offering sections for city selection (fixed to Salzburg for this report), a list of key attractions for route planning, and dynamic route information. This design facilitates a task-oriented user flow: select attractions -> optimize route -> explore map. The map itself displays various GeoJSON layers (POIs, predefined routes, areas) managed via a Leaflet Layer Control, allowing users to customize their view. This structure enhances usability by centralizing controls and providing an immediate visual response on the map. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
    - Report Info: Geographical landmarks, points of interest (POIs), a predefined river walk route, and the Old Town area in Salzburg.
    - Goal: Allow users to explore Salzburg's key features, understand their spatial distribution, and plan a basic optimized tour.
    - Viz/Presentation Method:
        - Interactive Map (Leaflet): Central visualization for all geospatial data.
        - Custom HTML/CSS Markers (Font Awesome icons within styled divs): For individual attractions and POIs.
        - GeoJSON LineStrings (Leaflet Layer): For the predefined Salzach River Walk route.
        - GeoJSON Polygons (Leaflet Layer): For the Salzburg Old Town area.
        - HTML List: For selectable "Top Attractions" for routing.
        - Textual Displays: For route optimization details (distance, time).
    - Interaction:
        - Popups: Clicking on any map feature (attraction, POI, route, area) displays detailed information.
        - Mouse-over Effects: Hovering over GeoJSON route lines or area polygons changes their style for visual feedback.
        - Layer Control: A Leaflet Layer Control allows users to toggle the visibility of base maps and GeoJSON overlay layers (POIs, River Walk, Old Town Area).
        - Attraction Selection: Clicking items in the "Top Attractions" list toggles their selection for route optimization.
        - Route Optimization Button: Triggers calculation and display of an optimized route via Leaflet Routing Machine.
        - Simulated Export Button: Demonstrates potential for map sharing.
    - Justification: Leaflet is ideal for interactive web maps. GeoJSON provides a structured way to represent spatial data. Custom markers and styled GeoJSON layers enhance personalization. The combination of selection, routing, and layer control provides a rich interactive experience tailored to geographical exploration. The current report does not contain quantitative data suitable for Chart.js or Plotly.js, so these libraries are included via CDN as per technical requirements but not actively used for visualizations, ensuring the primary map focus.
    - Library/Method: Leaflet.js, Leaflet Routing Machine, Font Awesome, Vanilla JavaScript, Tailwind CSS. Chart.js (CDN only, not used for visualization in this context due to data type). Plotly.js (CDN only, not used for visualization).
